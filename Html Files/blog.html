                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p> As a digital arts student, I have always been fascinated and intrigued by the intertwining and connection of art, technology, and information. Through my works, the artistic side has always been a very important aspect for me. When looking at data visualization, I was pleased to see that this is a good way for me to connect my artistic side with my technological side. In this critical blog post, I will be analyzing the reading on data visualization by Qi Li, relating it to my field of study and highlighting key aspects which resonate with me as a web designer/developer.
                   </p>
                   <h3>What is Data Visualisation?</h3> 
                    <p>Before we can begin analyzing the reading, we first need to define what exactly data visualization is. Without looking at any formal definitions, in my understanding, data visualization is the way in which we can showcase and represent data in a pleasing way which is easily digestible and understandable. Manovich defines data visualization as, “a transformation of quantified data which is not visual into a visual representation” (Manovich, 2010, as cited in Li, 2020). From this definition we can understand that data visualization is merely transforming large data sets into something visual. For example, transforming the data of a company's annual expenditure into a bar graph. Li goes into detail on the various different types of data visualizations and how each type would be best suited for different purposes (Li, 2020). The key takeaway from what he writes on that is, there are many ways of visualizing data and it is important that you choose a suitable and appropriate way based on the type of data you wish to showcase. </p>
                   <h3>Why is Data Visualisation Important?</h3>
                    <p>In every sector and industry, there are extremely large amounts of data which need to be showcased and represented. Some industries rely heavily on data, and for them, data visualization is crucial. For example, in the public health industry, being able to present data in an understandable manner is critical to the success of public health surveillance, and, health researchers make use of this data to aid their work and contribute beneficially to the public health sector (Sadiku et al., 2016).
                        Everywhere you look, you will find some sort of data visualizations. Weather reports, financial reports, maps and family lineage trees are just some of the many examples of where data visualization is used. Imagine switching on the TV to watch a weather report, and all you see is page with a bunch of words and numbers. This would be extremely confusing and not appealing to the viewers. However, if we were to look at a map which is colour coded according to the weather with the exact temperatures showed on the exact locations of the map, this is easy to understand and it is visually pleasing. Sadiku says that with the amount of data that is present on the internet, it is difficult for users to visualize, explore and use this enormous data (Sadiku et al., 2016). He also says that, if data is effectively represented, it enables decision makers to consume and understand these analytics and it makes it easier for them to make sense of this data (Sadiku et al., 2016). 
                        Another example of this that comes to mind is, if you were to pitch a business idea to potential investors, you need to effectively showcase and represent the important data so that the investors have a clearer understanding and so that they can make an informed decision. If you were to merely state to them that your business did $50k in revenue in year 1, and $500k in revenue in year 5, yes it will still convey the message because it is a small data set, but if you were to showcase this information on a graph for instance, you’d be able to visualize the rate of growth of the companys revenue and this will stand out more to the investors. Professor Unwin writes that, “graphics can reveal data features that statistics and models may miss” (Unwin, 2020). 
                        Therefore, we can understand why data visualization is important.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Data Visualisation for a Web Designer:</h3>
                        <p>One might say, sure, data visualization is important, but how does it relate to web design? Well, a lot of websites actually showcase data to their audience. During the pandemic, the World Health Organization website showcased a live count of the Covid-19 cases and deaths in every single country. They did this through showcasing a world map, and when you hover over a country, it will tell you how many cases and deaths of Covid-19 that specific country has. </p>
                        <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Screenshot 2023-07-31 at 16.45.31 (2).png" alt="screenshotimg">
                        <p>As we can see, this is an extremely intuitive and easy-to-understand way of showcasing this data. They went the extra step of adding interactivity to the data visualization, and this enhanced its effectiveness. 
                            There are many other examples of websites that make use of data visualizations, therefore implying the importance of data visualization for web designers. 
                            
                            Being able to make a website is one thing on its own, but if you cannot showcase the information of the website effectively, then the website loses its importance. 
                            
                            </p>
                            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                            <p>In this critical blog post, we have discussed what data visualization is, why it is important and how it relates to web design. It is clear that being able to accurately represent data and information is important for anyone who chooses to showcase data. As a web designer, showcasing data is a primary aspect of what we do and therefore, learning about data visualization is extremely crucial. I’ll end this with something that Sadiku and his fellow authors write, “data visualization helps communicate complex ideas with clarity, accuracy and efficiency”  (Sadiku et al., 2016).</p>

                  <article class="description">

                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p> As we have learned throughout this year, good UI and UX design in websites is paramount to having an overall good website. In this critical reflection, I will relate the checklists, principles, and advice from the lectures and readings to my UI and UX design, addressing what I have done well and what I could have done better.
                   </p>
                   <h3>Relating Lectures, Readings & Research to My Work:</h3> 
                   <h4>a. What I Have Implemented:</h4>
                    <p>There are many aspects of UI and UX which a designer should think about and implement on their websites. Through the lectures, readings and additional research, these are the few important aspects which I have focused on for my website.
                      In her lecture on UI/UX basics, Peta Goldberg highlighted the Serial Position effect. This is to emphasize key information in the beginning and end of the page, whilst placing the least important information in the middle (Goldberg, 2023). 
                       </p>
                       <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Home-min.png" alt="screenshotimg">
                       <p>In order to achieve this, I had placed my main header right at the top of the home page, and the button to direct users to the data-visualisation section right at the bottom, as these are the two most important parts of information that I want users to see and absorb.
                        Goldberg also speaks about readability and legability and how your text should be easy to understand, comfortable to read and easy to see (Goldberg, 2023). For this reason, I have used simple and readable fonts such as, Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma and Sans Serif. These are simple fonts and commonly used fonts, and it allows for my text to be readable and legible. 
                        Knaflic also makes mention of highlighting the important stuff by making use of font styles (bold, italic, underlined), as well as by using colour and size (Knaflic, 2015). As can be seen in the above wireframe of my homepage, in order to highlight the important information, I made the text bold, increased the font size and chose a white colour which stands out from the black background. 
                        </p>
                        <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Details-min.png" alt="screenshotimg">
                        <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Our Story-min.png" alt="screenshotimg">
                        <p>The above two pictures are wireframes of my blog page and design page. In these pictures you can also see how I have used bold text with a white colour for my headers, which stands out from the black background. You can also see the readability and legibility of the text. 
                          Another important aspect of UI/UX is alignment and symmetry, as Goldberg also mentions in her lecture (Goldberg 2023). I have always had an eye for things that are symmetrical as I have always found them to be most aesthetically pleasing. It might also be my OCD which makes me want everything to be neat and in order. For this reason, on my homepage, I have aligned all the text to the left, and the animated image to the right. For my blog page and design page, everything is aligned in the center and it is also symmetrical. 
                          
                          </p>

                          <p>In her article on what makes great websites, author Pam Berg states that you should plan for multiple paths throughout the site as websites aren’t, “a simple A-to-B line” (Berg, 2021). 
                            Taking this into consideration, whilst I do have a nav bar with the links to all the pages of my website, I have also included a button on the bottom of my homepage (as can be seen in the homepage wireframe above) to direct users to another page of my website. At the time of making my website, I was not too focused on the data-art section of my website, hence not adding in a button for that as well, however, I will be adding that into the next version of my website. “The best way to keep a person moving around your website is to have clear microcopy “ (Berg, 2021). This ties in with Knaflics principle of, ‘Don’t overcomplicate’, (Knaflic, 2015). In following these principles and in following the instructions of the brief, I made sure to have clear and concise wording in the menu/nav-bar of my website. There are 5 different pages of the website, namely, Home, Blog, Design, Data-Visualisation and Data-Art. I have used this same wording in my menu/nav-bar so that users know what each page is about before even clicking on the links. Since I do not yet have so much of information on my website, the matter of not overcomplicating wasn’t as difficult to deal with. On my home page I tried to summarize the key points of what my website is and what users can expect. When adding in the data-visualisation and data-art aspects to the website, I will need to focus more on not complicating the information. 
                            
                            </p>
                   <h4>b. What I Need To Implement:</h3>
                    <p> Whilst I did try to implement some of the more important aspects of good UI/UX design, there are still a few aspects which I can improve on and implement. For example, Goldberg mentions in her lecture that shapes imply meaning (Goldberg, 2023). At the time of making my website, this was not something I took into account or even thought of. Pam Berg also mentions how designers should harness the power of the footer menu (Berg, 2021). It could be due to the fact that the websites we make now aren’t exactly for the public and just for the markers to see, or due to the fact that we don’t need to showcase a whole lot of information on our websites, but I’ve struggled with adding in good footer menus on my websites. This is something that I do need to improve on. I find myself spending a lot of time on the aesthetic decisions of the website and not as much time on the actual UI/UX decisions and that is also something I need to change.
                        </p>
                        
                            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                            <p>Through this critical analysis of my UI and UX, I was able to understand what I have done well and what I need to improve on. As creators/designers, we don’t often pick up a magnetic glass and relate our work to the principles we have learned so this was definitely a good exercise to get into. As my website progresses I will continuously be making changes and I will now focus my time and attention on all the principles and checklists which I have learned. </p>

                    <h2 id="title">Blog 3 - Interaction for Data Visualisation </h2>
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down"></i>
                  </header>
                  <article class="description">

                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p> Throughout this degree, we’ve looked deeply at storytelling as well as interactivity. With interactive data visualization, we then begin to look at and understand how we can combine interactivity and storytelling to portray information in an easily accessible and understandable way on websites. In this blog post, I will be dissecting the close reading by Dimara and Perin and using it as a framework, along with other readings and articles to discuss what interactivity is, why it is important, and how it connects to data visualization.
                   </p>
                   <h3>What is Interactivity:</h3> 
                   
                    <p> We often hear and use the word interaction and interactivity in this course. So what exactly is interactivity? We have previously defined interactivity as something that is responsive, does not respond in a random fashion, requires effort, and causes a change (Geyser 2023). Using this definition, it means that something as simple as clicking on links or scrolling on websites is considered as interactivity on websites. All websites are interactive and it requires this interactivity in order to function. In this instance, we want to specifically define interaction or interactivity within data visualizations. Dimara and Perin define interaction for visualization as, “the interplay between a person and data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as such” (Dimara & Perin 2020). To simplify this, it basically means the connection between a user’s action with a data set and the outcome of this connection. There are many examples of this. One that comes to mind which I have spoken about in a previous blog post is the WHO Covid-19 data visualization. 


                       </p>
                       <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Screenshot 2023-07-31 at 16.45.31 (2).png" alt="screenshotimg">
                       <p> In this data visualization, the world map is represented. If you were to hover your mouse over a country it will show you the name of the country, the number of confirmed COVID cases in that country, as well as the number of deaths in that country. This is a perfect example of interactive data visualization as the user has to commit the action (hovering the mouse over a country) to the dataset (the world map), and in return, they will get the outcome (seeing the stats of that country). 


                        </p>
                        <h3>Why is Interactivity Important in Data Visualizations</h3>
                        <p>
                          Now that we know what interactivity is and how it ties in with data visualization, we can determine how the interactivity affects the data visualization. Interactivity is present in most things that are in the digital space and it is what makes the digital space interesting and popular. If you were to pick up a newspaper or magazine, there isn’t much interactivity as the only thing you can do is to look and read. However, with the digital space, you can click, scroll, tap, zoom, and interact as much as you’d like. 
Likewise with data visualizations, if you were to display a simple static visualization on your website, it would be similar to the newspaper and magazine. Users can simply look and read it, but that’s all. 
Murray states in his book that static visualizations can only offer precomposed views of data and the number of dimensions of data is limited (Murray 2013, pp.2). Going back to the WHO COVID example, imagine if that was a static and not an interactive data visualization. It would be extremely difficult to get all the information and even if they were able to show all of the data, it would not be in an easily digestible and understandable way. 
Dimara and Perin state that interaction is a means of amplifying cognition in human data exploration in which the human is in control of the information (Dimara & Perin 2020). 
In the article on transforming data visualization to improve transparency, the authors write that through interactive visualizations, transparency and reproducibility can be promoted (Weissgerber et al., 2016). They also mention that the common practice of displaying summary statistics in static line graphs can be misleading (Weissgerber et al., 2016). This is because, you are working with a large set of data and many different data distributions can lead to the same graph, which results in non-transparent and misleading data.

                          </p>

                          <p> After doing game design, I tend to try and gamify mundane things to make them more interesting and more digestible. I think that adding interactivity to the static data visualizations is a way of gamifying it. It just makes it more interesting to view and absorb. Imagine if, instead of having to read 100 pages of old and boring text from a book, it was somehow interactive. I know I’d much more enjoy going through those readings (especially the FVPA ones). 
                            On this note, Murray states that interactive visualizations can empower people to engage with and explore data for themselves, and it, “can make exploring data feel more playing like a game” (Murray 2013, pp.2).
                            Interactive visualizations not only make the data sets more appealing and more interesting, but they can also retain viewers’ attention and interest, which essentially is the main intention of websites. In their article on the effects of perceived interactivity and web organization on user attitudes, the authors write that, in engaging with interactive functions,  users are encouraged to stay longer on the website as well as evaluate it more positively (Ahn, Hong and Pedersen, 2014). 
                            
                            
                            </p>
                  
                        
                            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                            <p>Using the close reading as a framework, I have broken down what interactivity is and how it relates to and fits in with data visualizations. With the aid of other readings and articles, I have also clearly outlined what interactive data visualizations are and what their benefits are.
                              It is clear that interactive visualizations are better than static visualizations and they will allow viewers to understand, engage, and absorb data better. I now understand the importance and I know what I should aim to achieve in my future websites.

                              <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                              <p> For this entire semester, we focused on acquiring, reading, and visualizing data using api’s and d3.js. We have also learned the importance and significance of data-driven visualisations and how best to design and create these data-driven visualisations. In this reflective blog, I will be speaking about my planning, inspirations, and creative processes in creating my data art. I will also critically analyse what I have done well and what I could have done better.
                             </p>
                             <h3>Inspiration and Planning:</h3> 
                             
                              <p>  Prior to beginning with my data art, I had a few examples and pieces of inspiration for what I wanted to create. I was really interested in and leaning towards making a game for my data art. This is a game design focused course, and many of us have the passion and enjoyment for making games. I also thought that a game could be an interesting and fun way of representing art, as I know that I’d most definitely enjoy and prefer playing a game instead of merely just looking at something. 
                                This was the inspiration for the game I wanted to make:
                                
          
          
                                 </p>
                                 <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 14.39.11.png" alt="screenshotimg">
                                 <p>  However, I quickly realized that using live data from an api to create a game isn’t as easy as I thought. I tried and tried, but was not successful. I then had to move on to another idea that didn’t involve games.
          
          
                                  </p>

                                  <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 14.36.08.png" alt="screenshotimg">
                                  <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 14.23.27.png" alt="screenshotimg">

                                  <p>I then came across these examples and I loved them. Especially the flight path image on the right. However, for both of the above data arts, you would require the location and path of travel for the objects in order to represent it in that way. The Nasa asteroid API I used did not have any location or path traveled data. At this point, I had spent so much of time trying to find something I could use and trying to get something to work, but nothing seemed to work.

                                    I took a moment to breathe and gather my thoughts and decided to evaluate the data set to see what I could work with. In the API, the asteroids sizes, velocity and absolute magnitudes were available, so I knew that I had to use those.
                                    I eventually decided to keep it simple and try something which I was somewhat familiar with, and that was bubble charts.
                                    </p>

                                    <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 14.49.48.png" alt="screenshotimg">

                                    <p>I thought that this would be an appropriate and suitable way of showcasing data of asteroids. I wanted the sizes of the bubbles to represent the sizes of the asteroids, and the colours of the bubbles to represent the absolute magnitude(brightness) of the asteroids. I also wanted to add in a tooltip to add that small layer of interactivity. The tooltip would give extra information such as the name of the asteroid, the velocity and the value of its absolute magnitude.</p>

                                  <h3>Critical Analysis:</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    In their book on data-driven storytelling, the authors mentioned that data-visualisations should include exploration and explanation for the audience (Riche et al., 2018, pp.78, 81).
They go on to mention the benefits of exploration and of explanation in saying that, “Exploratory visualizations can provide readers with a feeling of agency” and, “Explanatory visualizations have the benefit that the provided message or interpretation can help engage an audience with no prior knowledge of or interest in a topic” (Riche et al., 2018, pp.78, 81).
With this in mind, I wanted to create something that was both exploratory and explanatory. 
Throughout most of our technical courses, we have learned about agency through interactivity, and what the benefits are.

          
                                    </p>


                                    <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 15.03.34.png" alt="screenshotimg">


          
                                    <p>  This is what I was finally able to create. Knaflic mentions in her book on storytelling with data that one of the tactics to help ensure that your story is clear is by using vertical logic (Knaflic, 2015, p.182). I have made use of vertical logic in my data art section as I have a body of text directly above the visualisation which provides a fun fact about asteroids as well as a brief description of what the data art signifies. The data art is vertically below the text and follows the vertical logic that Knaflic makes mention of.
                                      
                                      
                                      </p>

                                      <p>I wanted something that would appropriately and suitably match the data set and I think that the cluster of bubbles does that well. I knew I wanted something which would represent more than just one thing. In my data art, the bubble sizes represent the sizes of the asteroids, the colours represent the absolute magnitude of the asteroids, the brighter colours represent asteroids that have a higher absolute magnitude, and lastly, in order to add some interactivity to the art, I added in a tooltip which gives extra information about the 
                                        Asteroids when you hover over them. It gives you the name, speed and absolute magnitude value of the asteroid. I was hesitant on whether to add in interactivity or not, but I recalled something I read in Murrays book which states that interactive visualizations gamify the experience of exploring data and it can empower people to engage with the data and explore it for themselves, (Murray 2013, pp.2).
                                        </p>
                            
                                        <p>The difficult aspect of this task (apart from using APIs and d3) was deciding whether or not what you have created is art. If we begin to discuss what is art and what is not art, we will have an entire thesis on that. Whilst I am happy with what I have and whilst I do think that it serves its purpose as something that is explanatory and exploratory, I’m still not 100% sure whether or not this can be qualified as ‘art’. I also fear that what I have might be too basic, but unfortunately, all my other attempts at creating different data art were not successful. 
                                          In following with Knaflic, Murray and Riches teachings and principles, I do think that I have what they would classify as an interactive data-driven, storytelling art piece.
                                          </p>

                                          <p>In terms of what I would do to improve, I would definitely like to add more interactivity. Perhaps allowing users to drag the bubbles around. I was also thinking of adding in sound effects for when the bubbles are clicked or interacted with. I am happy with the design and style of the bubbles, but I am also considering making the bubbles look like asteroids, perhaps with asteroid images. </p>
                                  
                                      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                                      <p> I think this was one of the most challenging and time-consuming projects for me so far, but I am beyond pleased that I was able to finally get something that works and fulfils its purpose. 
                                        I know that there are many ways that I could improve on it and there are many changes I can make, and I am excited to see what more I could possibly add to it to make it a well-established explanatory and exploratory data-driven art.

                              <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                              <p> In a world with a plethora of information and data, it is important to be able to represent and convey this information and data significantly, accurately, and informatively. Throughout this semester we have learned about and explored various data visualisations and data arts and how it can be used to represent data. From static visualisations to interactive visualisations, to data-driven artworks, we have learned and practiced all of these. In this blog post, I will be dissecting the 3 close readings, along with what we have learned throughout the semester, as well as with independent research and additional resources in order to discuss the relationship between data visualisation, data art, and their strategies of representation.
                             </p>
                             <h3>Defining Data Visualisation and Data Art:</h3> 
                             
                              <p>  Before beginning with any type of analysis, it is important to define and break down the terms that you will be analysing. In previous blog posts, I have defined the above terms, but for the sake of clarity and understanding, I will briefly reexplain these terms and highlight a few purposes of each term. 
                                
          
          
                                 </p>
                                 <p>In Li’s book on the overview of data visualisation he provides various definitions of data visualisations from various different people. Kirk defines data visualisation as, “the representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities in order to amplify cognition” (Kirk, 2012, as cited in Li, 2020). To simplify this definition, data visualisation involves presenting data in a way that takes advantage of how our eyes and brain work together to enhance our understanding of the information. For example, instead of simply showing the profits vs expenditures of a company in a plain text form, you would showcase it as a data visualisation, perhaps through some sort of chart. When looking at this chart it would allow our brains to more easily visualize and understand the data shown.
                                  In their article on data visualisation as a communication tool, the authors state that effective data visualization aids in identifying patterns and relationships, enabling the communication of a message in a more engaging and compelling manner. It simplifies the comprehension of complex data, making it more accessible (Archambault et al., 2015).
                                  </p>
                                  <p>From the beginning of this degree, we argued on what can and cannot be classified as art. It is something that is continuously debated, however,  to aid in defining what data art is we will be looking at what Viegas and Wattenberg state. They mention that data art is, “visualisations of data done by artists with the intent of making art” (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007). They also give a few guidelines on what would qualify something as data art. Firstly they say that the artwork has to be data-driven and based on actual data, secondly, they state that if something is beautiful, it does not necessarily mean that is data-art, and likewise, a data visualisation that lacks beauty could still be considered as data-art, rather it is the intent of the piece that is more important than the aesthetics of the piece (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007). 
                                    There are specific reasons and purposes for why people make use of data art. Roeser states that data art, or as she terms it, techno-artworks has the ability to draw on the emotional and imaginative capabilities of people, as well as create awareness of societal issues (Roeser, 2016).
                                    </p>

                                  <h3>Representation of Data Visualisations and Data Art:</h3>
                                  <p>
                                    Kidd states that representation is “concerned with the construction of meaning” (Kidd, 2015). All forms of art are representations of something. Perhaps the artist wished to convey a certain message or theme, this is then represented through the art. In this degree we often deal with visual communications and visual representations, be it through the websites we make, the art we create, the games we make, or the stories we write. On the note of visual communication, Kidd mentions that visual communication is often more open to different interpretations as it presents itself as more ambiguous when compared to other forms of communication (Kidd, 2015). For example, when one looks at a painting, there are various interpretations of that painting. Someone might view the colour blue as sad and the colour red as danger, others might view it completely differently. This is why, when representing something like data, in order to get the intended meaning across, it is important to provide some sort of context and to represent the art in a way that is less ambiguous and more direct. Kidd mentions that context is everything when it comes to analysing any type of media or visualisation (Kidd, 2015).

                                    </p>


                                    <img class="screenshot-img" src="../Images/Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 19.04.18 (2).png" alt="screenshotimg">


          
                                    <p>  
                                      In the above picture, we can see an example of a data visualisation that represents and visualises the number of deaths, the timing, and the involvement of wars fought since 1900. The creator of this data visualisation states, “Each individual poppy stem grows from the year when the war started, and the flowers in the year the war ended. Its size reveals the number of deaths and the variation of colour represents the areas involved” (D’Efilippo, as cited in Jain and Foulds, 2022). The use of poppies in this visualisation is significant as it was a symbol of remembrance after the First World War. 
This is a prime example of the effectiveness of data visualisations in terms of their representation. If the data from that visualisation was showcased in plain text, it would most definitely not be as appealing and as effective as it is in the visualisation. Art has always been a powerful way of representing and signifying important messages, and when combining art with data, it allows us to showcase and represent the data in a much better way whilst also signifying certain messages. Segaran and Hamerbacher state that data visualisation techniques are not only about showcasing data in an aesthetically pleasing way, but it’s also about ‘knowledge generation’ and changing something in the world (Segaran and Hamerbacher, 2009, as cited in Kidd, 2015). As I’ve mentioned throughout this blog so far, data visualisations and data art allow for the ease and simplicity of visualizing data. The purpose is to allow viewers to gain a sense of understanding by merely just looking at the visualisation. Data visualisations should allow readers to let their eyes do the job of interpreting the data and it should minimize the amount of thinking that the reader has to do (Kirk et al., 2016, pp.11).

                                      
                                      </p>

                                      <h3>The Intersection of Data Visualisations and Data Art:</h3>
                                      <p>Throughout this blog, I have defined data visualisation and data art, and I have also explained how both are represented and what the benefits of these representations are. Lastly, I will briefly speak about how data visualisation and data art intersect.
                                        The coming together of data visualizations and data art creates a powerful blend where information goes beyond just being presented—it turns into a form of expression. While data visualizations usually focus on making complex information easy to understand, the combination with art adds a unique and expressive touch. 
                                        In most of the readings I have come across, the term data art was synonymous with data visualisation. Data art falls under the umbrella of data visualisation, because in essence, data art is a type of data visualisation. In her lecture on Art, Graphics and Visualisation, Geyser states that data art is the “interrogation and experimentation with the meanings of data visualisation” (Geyser, 2020). 
                                        According to Pousman et al, ”artistic visualizations are visualisations of data done by artists with the intent of making art” (Pousman et al., 2007). Therefore, whilst data art falls as part of data visualisation, what differentiates it is that it was made by an artist with the intent of making art.
                                        To sum this all up, the intersection of data visualizations and data art expands the ways we represent information. It allows for the inclusion of personal and cultural elements, making the visual representation more impactful. This intersection challenges the usual ways we think about presenting data, bringing in aspects like how things look, the intention behind them, and the artistic expression involved. The mix of art and data doesn’t just make information look good, it also makes it more meaningful and connects with people on a deeper level.

                                     <p>In wrapping things up, exploring data visualizations and data art this semester has shown how crucial they are for handling a lot of information. We've learned various ways to represent data, from static to interactive forms, giving us useful tools for dealing with the abundance of data.
                                      When we talk about data visualization and data art, we mean using visuals to help us understand information better. Data art, as pointed out by Roeser, not only taps into our feelings but also makes us aware of important issues. Kidd's focus on representation reminds us to keep things clear in visual communication, like in the impactful war data visualization with poppies. Viegas and Wattenberg provide an explanation for data art and how one could identify data art.
                                      The intersection of data visualizations and data art, explained by Geyser and Pousman et al., blends these methods beyond just presenting information. Visualizations aim for clarity, while data art adds a touch of personal expression and purpose, shaking up traditional ways of presenting data.
                                      In essence, this blend broadens how we show information, making it more impactful and meaningful. The mix of art and data isn't just about making things look good, it creates a strong connection with the audience, turning messages into stories that are both interesting and deep. Combining art and data emerges as a powerful way to encourage thought-provoking and meaningful communication and representation.
