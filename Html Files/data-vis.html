      <h2 class="p-title">A Cosmic Wonder Hidden In Plain Sight </h2>
  
      <p class="p-summary">Asteroids, those enigmatic space rocks, have long captured the imagination of both scientists and curious minds alike. These celestial bodies, remnants of the early solar system, are scattered throughout our cosmic neighborhood. But have you ever wondered just how big they are and how close they come to Earth?</p>
       <p class="p-summary"> In the scatter-plot graph on the right, you can get some sort of understanding as to how close they are to Earth, and how big they are.    </p>
       <p class="p-summary"> With the use of the NASA API, we are able to view the most recent and up-to-date data of these spectacular blobs of stone floating in space.</p>

      <h2 class="p-title">How Big Is It? </h2>

      <p class="p-summary">Asteroids vary widely in size, ranging from tiny pebbles to colossal space rocks. The smallest asteroids, often referred to as "meteoroids," can be as small as a grain of sand, while the largest ones, known as "planetesimals," can be hundreds of kilometers in diameter. The majority of asteroids fall somewhere in between, with diameters ranging from a few meters to tens of kilometers. These diverse sizes play a crucial role in understanding the potential impact hazards and the geological history of our solar system.</p>
       <p class="p-summary"> In the histogram on the left, we can gain an understanding of the sizes of these asteroids.    </p>

        Asteroids, the remnants of our solar system's formation, come in a staggering range of sizes. These celestial bodies, from tiny pebbles to enormous planetesimals, hold crucial clues about the early history of our universe.</p>
       <p class="p-summary">The bubble chart showcased here provides a fascinating visualization of asteroids' data, depicting their speeds on the X-axis, distances from Earth on the Y-axis, and their sizes represented by the size of the bubbles.Upon hovering over a bubble you will also be able to see the name of the asteroid, the date of the closest approach to Earth as well as the asteroids orbiting body. This interactive chart offers an intriguing perspective, allowing viewers to explore the relationship between an asteroid's size, its proximity to Earth, and the incredible speeds at which these space rocks travel. Through this visualization, one can gain valuable insights into the vast and diverse world of asteroids, shedding light on the complexities of these cosmic wanderers.     </p>
