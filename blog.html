                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p> As a digital arts student, I have always been fascinated and intrigued by the intertwining and connection of art, technology, and information. Through my works, the artistic side has always been a very important aspect for me. When looking at data visualization, I was pleased to see that this is a good way for me to connect my artistic side with my technological side. In this critical blog post, I will be analyzing the reading on data visualization by Qi Li, relating it to my field of study and highlighting key aspects which resonate with me as a web designer/developer.
                   </p>
                   <h3>What is Data Visualisation?</h3> 
                    <p>Before we can begin analyzing the reading, we first need to define what exactly data visualization is. Without looking at any formal definitions, in my understanding, data visualization is the way in which we can showcase and represent data in a pleasing way which is easily digestible and understandable. Manovich defines data visualization as, “a transformation of quantified data which is not visual into a visual representation” (Manovich, 2010, as cited in Li, 2020). From this definition we can understand that data visualization is merely transforming large data sets into something visual. For example, transforming the data of a company's annual expenditure into a bar graph. Li goes into detail on the various different types of data visualizations and how each type would be best suited for different purposes (Li, 2020). The key takeaway from what he writes on that is, there are many ways of visualizing data and it is important that you choose a suitable and appropriate way based on the type of data you wish to showcase. </p>
                   <h3>Why is Data Visualisation Important?</h3>
                    <p>In every sector and industry, there are extremely large amounts of data which need to be showcased and represented. Some industries rely heavily on data, and for them, data visualization is crucial. For example, in the public health industry, being able to present data in an understandable manner is critical to the success of public health surveillance, and, health researchers make use of this data to aid their work and contribute beneficially to the public health sector (Sadiku et al., 2016).
                        Everywhere you look, you will find some sort of data visualizations. Weather reports, financial reports, maps and family lineage trees are just some of the many examples of where data visualization is used. Imagine switching on the TV to watch a weather report, and all you see is page with a bunch of words and numbers. This would be extremely confusing and not appealing to the viewers. However, if we were to look at a map which is colour coded according to the weather with the exact temperatures showed on the exact locations of the map, this is easy to understand and it is visually pleasing. Sadiku says that with the amount of data that is present on the internet, it is difficult for users to visualize, explore and use this enormous data (Sadiku et al., 2016). He also says that, if data is effectively represented, it enables decision makers to consume and understand these analytics and it makes it easier for them to make sense of this data (Sadiku et al., 2016). 
                        Another example of this that comes to mind is, if you were to pitch a business idea to potential investors, you need to effectively showcase and represent the important data so that the investors have a clearer understanding and so that they can make an informed decision. If you were to merely state to them that your business did $50k in revenue in year 1, and $500k in revenue in year 5, yes it will still convey the message because it is a small data set, but if you were to showcase this information on a graph for instance, you’d be able to visualize the rate of growth of the companys revenue and this will stand out more to the investors. Professor Unwin writes that, “graphics can reveal data features that statistics and models may miss” (Unwin, 2020). 
                        Therefore, we can understand why data visualization is important.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Data Visualisation for a Web Designer:</h3>
                        <p>One might say, sure, data visualization is important, but how does it relate to web design? Well, a lot of websites actually showcase data to their audience. During the pandemic, the World Health Organization website showcased a live count of the Covid-19 cases and deaths in every single country. They did this through showcasing a world map, and when you hover over a country, it will tell you how many cases and deaths of Covid-19 that specific country has. </p>

                        <p>As we can see, this is an extremely intuitive and easy-to-understand way of showcasing this data. They went the extra step of adding interactivity to the data visualization, and this enhanced its effectiveness. 
                            There are many other examples of websites that make use of data visualizations, therefore implying the importance of data visualization for web designers. 
                            
                            Being able to make a website is one thing on its own, but if you cannot showcase the information of the website effectively, then the website loses its importance. 
                            
                            </p>
                            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                            <p>In this critical blog post, we have discussed what data visualization is, why it is important and how it relates to web design. It is clear that being able to accurately represent data and information is important for anyone who chooses to showcase data. As a web designer, showcasing data is a primary aspect of what we do and therefore, learning about data visualization is extremely crucial. I’ll end this with something that Sadiku and his fellow authors write, “data visualization helps communicate complex ideas with clarity, accuracy and efficiency”  (Sadiku et al., 2016).</p>
