                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p> As a digital arts student, I have always been fascinated and intrigued by the intertwining and connection of art, technology, and information. Through my works, the artistic side has always been a very important aspect for me. When looking at data visualization, I was pleased to see that this is a good way for me to connect my artistic side with my technological side. In this critical blog post, I will be analyzing the reading on data visualization by Qi Li, relating it to my field of study and highlighting key aspects which resonate with me as a web designer/developer.
                   </p>
                   <h3>What is Data Visualisation?</h3> 
                    <p>Before we can begin analyzing the reading, we first need to define what exactly data visualization is. Without looking at any formal definitions, in my understanding, data visualization is the way in which we can showcase and represent data in a pleasing way which is easily digestible and understandable. Manovich defines data visualization as, “a transformation of quantified data which is not visual into a visual representation” (Manovich, 2010, as cited in Li, 2020). From this definition we can understand that data visualization is merely transforming large data sets into something visual. For example, transforming the data of a company's annual expenditure into a bar graph. Li goes into detail on the various different types of data visualizations and how each type would be best suited for different purposes (Li, 2020). The key takeaway from what he writes on that is, there are many ways of visualizing data and it is important that you choose a suitable and appropriate way based on the type of data you wish to showcase. </p>
                   <h3>Why is Data Visualisation Important?</h3>
                    <p>In every sector and industry, there are extremely large amounts of data which need to be showcased and represented. Some industries rely heavily on data, and for them, data visualization is crucial. For example, in the public health industry, being able to present data in an understandable manner is critical to the success of public health surveillance, and, health researchers make use of this data to aid their work and contribute beneficially to the public health sector (Sadiku et al., 2016).
                        Everywhere you look, you will find some sort of data visualizations. Weather reports, financial reports, maps and family lineage trees are just some of the many examples of where data visualization is used. Imagine switching on the TV to watch a weather report, and all you see is page with a bunch of words and numbers. This would be extremely confusing and not appealing to the viewers. However, if we were to look at a map which is colour coded according to the weather with the exact temperatures showed on the exact locations of the map, this is easy to understand and it is visually pleasing. Sadiku says that with the amount of data that is present on the internet, it is difficult for users to visualize, explore and use this enormous data (Sadiku et al., 2016). He also says that, if data is effectively represented, it enables decision makers to consume and understand these analytics and it makes it easier for them to make sense of this data (Sadiku et al., 2016). 
                        Another example of this that comes to mind is, if you were to pitch a business idea to potential investors, you need to effectively showcase and represent the important data so that the investors have a clearer understanding and so that they can make an informed decision. If you were to merely state to them that your business did $50k in revenue in year 1, and $500k in revenue in year 5, yes it will still convey the message because it is a small data set, but if you were to showcase this information on a graph for instance, you’d be able to visualize the rate of growth of the companys revenue and this will stand out more to the investors. Professor Unwin writes that, “graphics can reveal data features that statistics and models may miss” (Unwin, 2020). 
                        Therefore, we can understand why data visualization is important.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Data Visualisation for a Web Designer:</h3>
                        <p>One might say, sure, data visualization is important, but how does it relate to web design? Well, a lot of websites actually showcase data to their audience. During the pandemic, the World Health Organization website showcased a live count of the Covid-19 cases and deaths in every single country. They did this through showcasing a world map, and when you hover over a country, it will tell you how many cases and deaths of Covid-19 that specific country has. </p>
                        <img class="screenshot-img" src="./Images/Screenshot 2023-07-31 at 16.45.31 (2).png" alt="screenshotimg">
                        <p>As we can see, this is an extremely intuitive and easy-to-understand way of showcasing this data. They went the extra step of adding interactivity to the data visualization, and this enhanced its effectiveness. 
                            There are many other examples of websites that make use of data visualizations, therefore implying the importance of data visualization for web designers. 
                            
                            Being able to make a website is one thing on its own, but if you cannot showcase the information of the website effectively, then the website loses its importance. 
                            
                            </p>
                            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                            <p>In this critical blog post, we have discussed what data visualization is, why it is important and how it relates to web design. It is clear that being able to accurately represent data and information is important for anyone who chooses to showcase data. As a web designer, showcasing data is a primary aspect of what we do and therefore, learning about data visualization is extremely crucial. I’ll end this with something that Sadiku and his fellow authors write, “data visualization helps communicate complex ideas with clarity, accuracy and efficiency”  (Sadiku et al., 2016).</p>

                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p> As we have learned throughout this year, good UI and UX design in websites is paramount to having an overall good website. In this critical reflection, I will relate the checklists, principles, and advice from the lectures and readings to my UI and UX design, addressing what I have done well and what I could have done better.
                   </p>
                   <h3>Relating Lectures, Readings & Research to My Work:</h3> 
                   <h4>a. What I Have Implemented:</h4>
                    <p>There are many aspects of UI and UX which a designer should think about and implement on their websites. Through the lectures, readings and additional research, these are the few important aspects which I have focused on for my website.
                      In her lecture on UI/UX basics, Peta Goldberg highlighted the Serial Position effect. This is to emphasize key information in the beginning and end of the page, whilst placing the least important information in the middle (Goldberg, 2023). 
                       </p>
                       <img class="screenshot-img" src="./Images/Home-min.png" alt="screenshotimg">
                       <p>In order to achieve this, I had placed my main header right at the top of the home page, and the button to direct users to the data-visualisation section right at the bottom, as these are the two most important parts of information that I want users to see and absorb.
                        Goldberg also speaks about readability and legability and how your text should be easy to understand, comfortable to read and easy to see (Goldberg, 2023). For this reason, I have used simple and readable fonts such as, Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma and Sans Serif. These are simple fonts and commonly used fonts, and it allows for my text to be readable and legible. 
                        Knaflic also makes mention of highlighting the important stuff by making use of font styles (bold, italic, underlined), as well as by using colour and size (Knaflic, 2015). As can be seen in the above wireframe of my homepage, in order to highlight the important information, I made the text bold, increased the font size and chose a white colour which stands out from the black background. 
                        </p>
                        <img class="screenshot-img" src="./Images/Details-min.png" alt="screenshotimg">
                        <img class="screenshot-img" src="./Images/Our Story-min.png" alt="screenshotimg">
                        <p>The above two pictures are wireframes of my blog page and design page. In these pictures you can also see how I have used bold text with a white colour for my headers, which stands out from the black background. You can also see the readability and legibility of the text. 
                          Another important aspect of UI/UX is alignment and symmetry, as Goldberg also mentions in her lecture (Goldberg 2023). I have always had an eye for things that are symmetrical as I have always found them to be most aesthetically pleasing. It might also be my OCD which makes me want everything to be neat and in order. For this reason, on my homepage, I have aligned all the text to the left, and the animated image to the right. For my blog page and design page, everything is aligned in the center and it is also symmetrical. 
                          
                          </p>

                          <p>In her article on what makes great websites, author Pam Berg states that you should plan for multiple paths throughout the site as websites aren’t, “a simple A-to-B line” (Berg, 2021). 
                            Taking this into consideration, whilst I do have a nav bar with the links to all the pages of my website, I have also included a button on the bottom of my homepage (as can be seen in the homepage wireframe above) to direct users to another page of my website. At the time of making my website, I was not too focused on the data-art section of my website, hence not adding in a button for that as well, however, I will be adding that into the next version of my website. “The best way to keep a person moving around your website is to have clear microcopy “ (Berg, 2021). This ties in with Knaflics principle of, ‘Don’t overcomplicate’, (Knaflic, 2015). In following these principles and in following the instructions of the brief, I made sure to have clear and concise wording in the menu/nav-bar of my website. There are 5 different pages of the website, namely, Home, Blog, Design, Data-Visualisation and Data-Art. I have used this same wording in my menu/nav-bar so that users know what each page is about before even clicking on the links. Since I do not yet have so much of information on my website, the matter of not overcomplicating wasn’t as difficult to deal with. On my home page I tried to summarize the key points of what my website is and what users can expect. When adding in the data-visualisation and data-art aspects to the website, I will need to focus more on not complicating the information. 
                            
                            </p>
                   <h4>b. What I Need To Implement:</h3>
                    <p> Whilst I did try to implement some of the more important aspects of good UI/UX design, there are still a few aspects which I can improve on and implement. For example, Goldberg mentions in her lecture that shapes imply meaning (Goldberg, 2023). At the time of making my website, this was not something I took into account or even thought of. Pam Berg also mentions how designers should harness the power of the footer menu (Berg, 2021). It could be due to the fact that the websites we make now aren’t exactly for the public and just for the markers to see, or due to the fact that we don’t need to showcase a whole lot of information on our websites, but I’ve struggled with adding in good footer menus on my websites. This is something that I do need to improve on. I find myself spending a lot of time on the aesthetic decisions of the website and not as much time on the actual UI/UX decisions and that is also something I need to change.
                        </p>
                        
                            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                            <p>Through this critical analysis of my UI and UX, I was able to understand what I have done well and what I need to improve on. As creators/designers, we don’t often pick up a magnetic glass and relate our work to the principles we have learned so this was definitely a good exercise to get into. As my website progresses I will continuously be making changes and I will now focus my time and attention on all the principles and checklists which I have learned. </p>
