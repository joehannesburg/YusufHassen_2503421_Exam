          <p> <span>Goal Alignment</span> - The goal for this website was to create something that would be informative, interactive and immersive, whilst making use of the Nasa Api.</p>
            <p> <span>Information Structure</span></p>
            <p class="indent-txt"> a)Home - The home page should give a brief overview of what the website entails and what the users can expect to see. It should have links to all the other pages.</p>
           <p class="indent-txt"> b)Blog - The blog page will have all the blogs completed throughout the semester. Ideally it should be systemized and orderly.</p> 
           <p class="indent-txt"> c)Design - The design page will be the longest page of the website. It will need to represent the design process of the website and show the improvements made throughout. It should also be orderly and systemized.</p>
           <p class="indent-txt"> d)Data-Visualisation - The Data-Visualisation page will be the most important page of the website. It is where the Nasa Api will be used and where the data from the api will be visualized in an efficient, interactive and immersive way.  </p>
           <p class="indent-txt"> e)Data-Art - The Data-Art page is the last page of the website and is where the final data art will be represented.</p>
           <!-- <p><span>User Flow</span> </p
           <img src="./Images/Untitled_Artwork (1).jpg" alt="User Flow image">
              -->
             
             
              <p><span>Interface Elements</span> - In terms of interface elements, the main things I will be using are links for the navigation as well as dropdown buttons for the blog posts. There will also be two buttons on the homepage which will navigate to the data-visualisation and data-art page.</p>
                <p><span>Style Process</span> </p>
                <p class="indent-txt">Visual Aesthetic - Due to the fact that we will be using the Nasa Api for this website, I wanted to have a space themed website. All the visual aesthetics of the website will be space themed and relate to the purpose of the website. </p>
                <p class="indent-txt">Visual Design Elements:</p>
                <p class="indent-txt">a)Fonts - The fonts I used are simple, yet common fonts. I used Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma and Sans Serif.</p>
                <img src="./Images/Screenshot 2023-09-11 at 10.26.13.png" alt="Font Image">

                <p class="indent-txt">b)Readability - Due to using simple fonts, all my text is readable. I have made the font sizes readable as well. All important information are represented as a bold header. Over the darker, black backgrounds the text is white and over the lighter, greyish background, black text is used. </p>
                <p class="indent-txt">c)Colours - In aligning with the space theme and aesthetic, I have used blacks, whites and greys. These colours represent space and will tie in with the narrative and purpose of the website.</p>
               <p class="indent-txt">d)Colour Theory - The colour palettes I have used are a range of blacks and greys. #8f8f8f, #ffffff, #7b7b7b, #909090, #838383. All these colours blend in well together.</p>

        <p><span>Goal & Aesthetic</span> - My goal is to have a website that can display and visualize information and data in an interesting, immersive and interactive way. Due to the information being showcased being about asteroids and space, I aimed to match my aesthetic to this as well. </p>
        <p><span>Visual Design Elements</span> - The visual design elements I made use of is a simple background with the colour palette mentioned above. In order to highlight the text more I added in a background for the text which is a gradient of white and grey. My text is either black or white and with a simple font. There is nothing too fancy or extraordinary, but rather, simple and sufficient.</p>

        <article class="improve-content">
        <p><span>Submission 2:</span>  </p>
        <p class="indent-txt">a) Style - I maintained the same style from my last submission and did not change much of the aesthetics. I was happy with my theme and aesthetics of the website as I felt that it had matched the API well.   </p>
        <p class="indent-txt">b) HTML - The main HTML changes I made was for the data-visualisation section. I've been able to maintain my semantic markup throughout my code and I did not need to change much with regards to that. The only thing I have not yet added are more footers, but I will be adding that for my next submission. </p>
        <p class="indent-txt">c) CSS - I ensured that all my styling was solely in CSS, and not in HTML. The only additional styling I have added is for the data-visualisaton section. I also made sure to have a correct and sustainable naming convention for all my CSS so that when I need to make changes it is easy to go back to and change. As part of the feedback I received from the last assignment, I have changed the styling of my nav bars and of the content on the pages. I made the  nav-bar background slightly bigger and I added padding to the links so that even when hovering over the links it will still remain aligned with the background. I have also changed the max-width of my containers on the blog page and design page so that the entire width of the screen is not filled with text.</p>
        <p class="indent-txt">d) JavaScript - This was the most JS I have ever written and most of my data-visualisation page is run by JS. I'm not the biggest fan of JS and it took me a long time to figure out how to get everything working, but I was able to create what I needed to with JS. I have followed most of the JS conventions, such as consistent use of 'const', correct camelCase and so on. I know I could've added more JS to the rest of my website, but I wanted to focus on getting the data-visualisation right before I could do anything else. I will be adding more JS to my website for the next submission. </p>

         <p><span>Submission 3:</span> </p>
          <p class="indent-txt">a) Style -   </p>

          <p class="indent-txt">c) CSS -  </p>
          <p class="indent-txt">d) JavaScript -   </p>
